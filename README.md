# Introduction
Systems is a mod for Software Inc by Coredumping. The mods adds new software & company types to the game. http://softwareinc.coredumping.com/

# Software
Current software types. I'll try to kepp this list up to date.
- CPU driver (simple system based software type)
- GPU driver (2D and 3D operating systems aswell)
- Audio driver (featuring all audio features from OS)
- Network driver (since 1985, network skill only)
- Framework (since 1990, making money by aiding devs)
- Text editor (basic office tool to start with)
- Spreadsheet (since 1985, office program for tables)
- Mailing Tool (since 1985, stay in contact)
- System Management Tool (since 1985, another maintenance tool)
- Rule engine (since 1995, prework for AI)
- Artificial intelligence (since 2000, robot mind)
- Automatic control system (since 2015, might replace administrators)

# Company
Currently I defined three types of companies, I think this should be fine.
- (Hard-) Technology, developping drivers
- (Soft-) Technology, developping technology and maintenance tools
- Office Tools, developping text editors and spreadsheet programs

# Personalities
I also included some themed personalities to the mod
- Knowledge driven, those people gaining skill faster than others
- Business driven, true leaders
- Lazy, those workers don't like working
- Diligent, the opposite of lazy personality

# Contribution and licensing
I appreciate any kind of feedback and suggestions. I like that data driven modding concept of the game so I won't reject any request without a good reason. Feel free to use the personalities and name generators for your own mod. Please be cooperative and mention me then. This project is a mod so it's not recommended or encouraged to use it for making money.
I am globally the only cray935, so it does not matter where if you find this name it is me.
